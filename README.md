# Purpose

This is a Windows system tray application that freezes the mouse pointer on the screen while still enabling the mouse scroll wheel. It was developed so that I can scroll a PDF file I am reading on a Windows tablet using the scroll wheel without the need to swipe manually every time I want to the page up. Call me a very lazy reader!

## How to Use

Place FreezeMouse.exe in any folder and double click on it. The app runs and you'll get a new icon in the system tray which looks like a stop sign with a mouse pointer in it.  
  
To freeze mouse pointer movements, move the mouse pointer anywhere very close to the right horizontal bar and left mouse click. This freezes the pointer in place. To unfreeze it, left mouse click again. I do this in my PDF reader where I scroll pages using the mouse wheel while the mouse pointer stays in place away from my main view and without distraction.  
  
To close the app, right click on its icon in the system tray and select Exit.
